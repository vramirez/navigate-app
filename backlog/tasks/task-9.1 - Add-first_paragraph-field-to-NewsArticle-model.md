## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Added a `first_paragraph` TextField to the NewsArticle model to improve UI display. This field:
- Stores only the first substantial paragraph of the article (auto-extracted)
- Is displayed in the Dashboard UI instead of the full content
- Reduces visual clutter and improves readability
- Keeps the full `content` field intact for ML analysis

The extraction logic intelligently:
- Cleans HTML from content
- Identifies the first substantial paragraph (>50 chars)
- Falls back to truncating at sentence boundaries if no clear paragraph structure
- Is applied automatically during both RSS and manual crawling

## Implementation Summary

### Backend Changes

1. **Model Update** ([models.py](../../backend/news/models.py#L524))
   - Added `first_paragraph` TextField with `blank=True`
   - Added to protected fields in `save()` method to prevent manual modification
   - Migration created: `0006_newsarticle_first_paragraph_and_more.py`

2. **Content Processor** ([content_processor.py](../../backend/news/services/content_processor.py#L34))
   - Added `_extract_first_paragraph()` method with smart extraction logic
   - Updated `_standardize_rss_entry()` to extract first paragraph
   - Updated `_standardize_manual_article()` to extract first paragraph
   - Extraction handles HTML cleaning, paragraph splitting, and sentence boundaries

3. **API Serialization** ([serializers.py](../../backend/news/serializers.py#L54))
   - Added `first_paragraph` to NewsArticleSerializer fields

4. **Admin Interface** ([admin.py](../../backend/news/admin.py#L326))
   - Added `first_paragraph` to readonly_fields
   - Added to fieldset display for article viewing

### Frontend Changes

1. **Data Transformer** ([dataTransformers.js](../../frontend/src/utils/dataTransformers.js#L58))
   - Added `firstParagraph` field to `transformArticleToNews()`
   - Falls back to full content if first_paragraph is empty (for old articles)

2. **Dashboard UI** ([Dashboard.jsx](../../frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx#L375))
   - Changed content display to use `news.firstParagraph` instead of `news.content`
   - Added comment explaining the change

## Testing Results

- ✅ Migration created and applied successfully
- ✅ First paragraph extraction logic tested and working correctly
- ✅ API returns `first_paragraph` field in responses
- ✅ Test article created with first_paragraph populated (ID: 699)
- ✅ Frontend data transformer includes firstParagraph field
- ✅ Dashboard UI displays first paragraph instead of full content

## Notes

- **Backward Compatibility**: Old articles have empty `first_paragraph` field, which falls back to displaying full content in the frontend
- **Future Enhancement**: Consider creating a backfill script (task-13) to populate `first_paragraph` for existing articles
- **ML Pipeline**: Full `content` field remains unchanged and available for ML analysis
