## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Add Ollama container with Llama 3.2 1B model to run LLM-based feature extraction alongside existing spaCy pipeline. Run both methods for high-suitability articles and compare results.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Implementation Plan

1. ✅ Docker Infrastructure Setup
2. ✅ Backend Dependencies
3. ✅ LLM Extractor Service
4. ✅ Database Schema Changes
5. ✅ Pipeline Integration
6. ✅ Documentation
7. ⏳ Testing & Validation

## Progress Log

### 2025-10-20 - Initial Implementation Complete

**Docker Setup:**
- Added `ollama` service to `docker-compose.dev.yml` with health checks
- Created volume `ollama_data` for model persistence
- Added `OLLAMA_HOST` environment variable to backend and worker services
- Created `scripts/setup-ollama.sh` to automate model download

**Backend Changes:**
- Added `ollama==0.4.4` to `requirements.txt`
- Created `backend/ml_engine/services/llm_extractor.py`:
  - Singleton pattern LLMExtractor class
  - Structured JSON prompt for feature extraction
  - Error handling with timeouts and retries
  - Compatible output format with FeatureExtractor
- Created migration `0011_add_llm_extraction_fields.py`:
  - `llm_features_extracted` (Boolean)
  - `llm_extraction_results` (JSONField)
  - `llm_extraction_date` (DateTimeField)
  - `extraction_comparison` (JSONField)

**ML Pipeline Integration:**
- Modified `backend/ml_engine/services/ml_pipeline.py`:
  - Added LLMExtractor import and initialization
  - Created `_compare_extractions()` method for result comparison
  - Updated `process_article()` to run LLM extraction for articles with suitability >= 0.3
  - Stores both spaCy and LLM results with comparison metrics
  - Graceful fallback if LLM extraction fails

**Documentation:**
- Updated README.md with:
  - Technology stack update (added Ollama)
  - Dual extraction pipeline explanation
  - LLM configuration section with environment variables
  - Testing commands and usage instructions
  - Performance considerations
- Updated Quick Start to include `setup-ollama.sh` script

**Key Features:**
- **Selective Processing**: Only high-suitability articles (>= 0.3) get LLM extraction
- **Parallel Comparison**: Both spaCy and LLM results stored for analysis
- **Comparison Metrics**: Agreement rate, completeness scores, field-by-field differences
- **Graceful Degradation**: System works with spaCy-only if LLM unavailable
- **Async Processing**: Celery handles LLM calls without blocking

**Files Modified:**
- `docker/docker-compose.dev.yml`
- `backend/requirements.txt`
- `backend/news/models.py`
- `backend/ml_engine/services/ml_pipeline.py`
- `README.md`

**Files Created:**
- `scripts/setup-ollama.sh`
- `backend/ml_engine/services/llm_extractor.py`
- `backend/news/migrations/0011_add_llm_extraction_fields.py`

**Ready for Testing:**
- Need to start Docker services and run `setup-ollama.sh`
- Need to process sample articles and verify LLM extraction works
- Need to compare extraction quality between spaCy and LLM

### 2025-10-22 - Bug Fixes and Merge to Main

**Issues Fixed:**
- Fixed port conflict: Changed Docker Ollama port from 11434 to 11435
- Fixed service checks in `setup-ollama.sh` (grep "Up" instead of "running")
- Fixed health check to use "ollama list" instead of curl
- Fixed hanging wait loop by adding -T flag to exec commands
- Removed interactive "ollama run" test that was freezing
- Fixed spaCy model installation (uncommented in Dockerfiles, upgraded to medium model)
- Fixed JSON serialization error: Convert datetime to ISO format string in llm_extractor.py:184

**Testing Status:**
- Successfully tested with `process_articles --reprocess` on 699 articles
- LLM extraction confirmed working (slow on CPU ~120s per article)
- Both spaCy and LLM extractions storing correctly in database

**Merge Complete:**
- All 9 commits from task-9.6-ollama-llm-integration merged to main
- Changes pushed to origin/main (commit d3c86b4)
- Feature branch ready for cleanup
- Task status: Review (ready for human validation)
