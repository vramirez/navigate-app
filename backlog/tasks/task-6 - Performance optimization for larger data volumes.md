## Description

Optimize the NaviGate system for handling larger data volumes as the news crawler accumulates thousands of articles and the recommendation engine processes increasing amounts of content.

Current system works well with demo data and initial real data, but needs optimization for production scale: 10,000+ articles, 100+ businesses, continuous crawling.

## Performance Targets

### Current Baseline (to be measured)
- Dashboard load time with 100 articles
- ML processing time for 100 articles
- Database query times
- Crawler throughput

### Production Targets
- Dashboard load time: <2 seconds (1000+ articles in DB)
- ML processing: 100+ articles/minute
- API response time: <500ms for paginated requests
- Database queries: <100ms for common operations
- Crawler throughput: 1000+ articles/hour

## Optimization Areas

### 1. Database Optimization
- Add indexes on frequently queried fields (published_date, news_source, created_at)
- Implement database query optimization (select_related, prefetch_related)
- Add database connection pooling
- Consider read replicas for heavy queries
- Implement database vacuum/analyze schedule

### 2. API Pagination & Caching
- Implement cursor-based pagination for articles
- Add Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Cache ML recommendation results (TTL: 1 hour)
- Implement HTTP caching headers (ETag, Last-Modified)
- Add API response compression (gzip)

### 3. ML Pipeline Optimization
- Batch processing for multiple articles
- Cache spaCy NLP results to avoid reprocessing
- Implement async task queue (Celery) for background processing
- Add incremental processing (only new articles)
- Optimize spaCy pipeline (disable unused components)

### 4. Frontend Optimization
- Implement virtual scrolling for long article lists
- Add lazy loading for images and content
- Optimize bundle size (code splitting)
- Implement service worker for offline caching
- Add skeleton screens for perceived performance

### 5. Crawler Optimization
- Parallel crawling with worker pools
- Implement crawl scheduling (avoid peak hours)
- Add incremental crawling (only fetch new articles)
- Optimize robots.txt caching
- Reduce network overhead (compression, keep-alive)

### 6. Monitoring & Profiling
- Add performance monitoring (Django Debug Toolbar)
- Implement application performance monitoring (APM)
- Set up query logging for slow queries
- Add custom metrics (Prometheus/Grafana)
- Create performance regression tests

## Implementation Plan

1. **Baseline Measurement:**
   - Profile current performance with realistic data load
   - Identify bottlenecks (database, API, ML, frontend)
   - Document current metrics

2. **Database Optimization:**
   - Analyze query patterns with Django Debug Toolbar
   - Add strategic indexes
   - Optimize ORM queries
   - Test with large dataset (10K+ articles)

3. **Caching Layer:**
   - Set up Redis for Django
   - Implement cache decorators for expensive operations
   - Cache ML results and API responses
   - Add cache invalidation strategy

4. **Async Processing:**
   - Set up Celery with Redis broker
   - Move ML processing to background tasks
   - Implement crawling job queue
   - Add task monitoring dashboard

5. **Frontend Optimization:**
   - Analyze bundle size with Vite build analyzer
   - Implement code splitting
   - Add virtual scrolling component
   - Optimize React re-renders

6. **Load Testing:**
   - Create load testing scripts (Locust or JMeter)
   - Simulate 1000+ concurrent users
   - Test with 10K+ articles in database
   - Measure and validate improvements

7. **Monitoring Setup:**
   - Implement logging aggregation
   - Set up performance dashboards
   - Create alerts for performance degradation
   - Document monitoring runbook

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Performance baseline documented for all major operations
- [ ] Database indexes added for high-traffic queries
- [ ] Redis caching implemented for API and ML results
- [ ] Celery task queue operational for background processing
- [ ] Frontend bundle size reduced by 30%+
- [ ] Virtual scrolling implemented for article lists
- [ ] Load testing completed with 1000+ concurrent users
- [ ] Performance targets met (see Production Targets above)
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards operational
- [ ] Performance regression tests added to CI/CD

## Notes

**Technologies to Add:**
- **Redis:** In-memory caching and Celery broker
- **Celery:** Distributed task queue for async processing
- **Django Debug Toolbar:** Query profiling
- **Locust or k6:** Load testing
- **Prometheus + Grafana:** Monitoring (optional, Phase 4)

**Docker Updates:**
- Add Redis container to docker-compose.yml
- Add Celery worker container
- Add Celery beat (scheduler) container
- Update environment variables for caching config

**Estimated Effort:** Large (L) - 4-5 days

**Priority Justification:**
- Medium priority: Not blocking Phase 3 completion
- Important for production readiness (Phase 4)
- Can be done incrementally

## Related Tasks

- Independent: Can be done in parallel with other Phase 3 tasks
- Enables: Phase 4 production deployment
- Benefits: All backend and frontend components
