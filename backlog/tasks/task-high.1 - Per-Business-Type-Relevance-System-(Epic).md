## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Complete architectural refactor to support per-business-type relevance scoring. Each article gets 4 separate relevance scores (pub, restaurant, coffee_shop, bookstore) instead of one global score. Users see articles filtered and sorted by THEIR business type's relevance score.
