## Description

Enhance the ML recommendation engine with advanced features leveraging real news content. This includes improved NLP analysis, pattern recognition, and intelligent recommendation scoring based on actual Colombian business and news data.

This task goes beyond basic integration (task-4) to implement sophisticated ML features that provide actionable, high-quality business insights.

## Proposed Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Spanish NLP
- Upgrade to larger spaCy model (es_core_news_lg) for better accuracy
- Add custom entity recognition for Colombian locations (Medellín, Bogotá, etc.)
- Implement sentiment analysis for news articles
- Extract action verbs and business opportunities

### 2. Pattern Recognition
- Identify recurring events (annual festivals, regular occurrences)
- Detect trend patterns across multiple articles
- Correlate related news stories
- Recognize seasonal business opportunities

### 3. Smart Recommendation Scoring
- Multi-factor scoring: relevance, urgency, impact, feasibility
- Historical performance tracking (which recommendations users acted on)
- Business-specific customization (coffee shop vs bookstore different weights)
- Confidence intervals based on data quality

### 4. Content Categorization
- Automatic tagging of article types (event, trend, crisis, opportunity)
- Business vertical classification (hospitality, retail, services)
- Geographic scope detection (neighborhood, city, national)
- Time sensitivity classification (immediate, short-term, long-term)

### 5. Event Timeline Extraction
- Parse event dates from Spanish text ("5 de octubre", "próximo fin de semana")
- Build event calendars for businesses
- Lead time calculation (how far in advance to act)
- Recurring event detection

## Implementation Plan

1. Research and select advanced NLP libraries for Spanish
2. Design multi-factor scoring algorithm
3. Implement custom entity recognition training
4. Build pattern detection algorithms
5. Create recommendation quality metrics
6. Develop A/B testing framework for algorithm improvements
7. Implement caching and performance optimizations
8. Create visualization tools for ML insights

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Advanced spaCy model integrated (es_core_news_lg)
- [ ] Custom Colombian entity recognition achieves 90%+ accuracy
- [ ] Multi-factor scoring implemented and documented
- [ ] Pattern recognition identifies at least 3 event types
- [ ] Event date extraction works for common Spanish formats
- [ ] Recommendation quality improved by 25% (measured via user feedback)
- [ ] Performance maintained: <5s processing per article
- [ ] A/B testing framework operational
- [ ] Documentation for ML pipeline architecture

## Notes

**Technologies to Explore:**
- spaCy es_core_news_lg (large Spanish model)
- Custom NER training with Prodigy or spaCy training
- scikit-learn for pattern detection
- dateparser library for Spanish date extraction
- pytest for ML testing framework

**Data Requirements:**
- Training data for Colombian entities (locations, businesses)
- Historical recommendation feedback for scoring tuning
- Validation dataset of manually labeled articles

**Success Metrics:**
- Recommendation precision: 85%+
- Recommendation recall: 75%+
- User engagement: 50%+ click-through on recommendations
- False positive rate: <15%

**Estimated Effort:** Large (L) - 3-5 days
